# weapon-detection-deep-learning
The three tools that are being looked at are YOLO(You Only Look Once), DETR (DEtection TRansformers), and ViT (Vision Transformer). These are various deep learning models and architectures used in computer vision and object detection tasks. The idea is to see how these tools can be used to optimize weapon detection.
